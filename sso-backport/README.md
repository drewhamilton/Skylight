## Skylight: sunrise-sunset.org implementation

An implementation that uses [sunrise-sunset.org](https://sunrise-sunset.org/)'s publicly available
[API](https://sunrise-sunset.org/api) to determine skylight information.

Note that sunrise-sunset.org's API page says "You may not use this API in a manner that exceeds reasonable request
volume, constitutes excessive or abusive usage." The same requirement applies to this module of Skylight.
